# INTERN TAKE HOME ASSIGNMENT

**Note: python 3 is used. All output can be seen in output.txt at the root level**

### Set Up Instructions
1) create a python 3 virtual environment on terminal: ```python3 -m venv envName```
2) activate virtual environment ```. envName/bin/activate```
3) clone this repo and cd into it
4) install the requirements: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```


### Run Program
1) cd to **src** directory and issue the following command ```python calculate.py```


### Run Tests
1) cd to **root** directory and issue the following command ```python -m pytest```

### Notes
The reading file function is a seperate function in calculate.py . I was considering making this into a seperate file, but given the specs of the project it seemed a little unnecessary. Ultimately that was a design decision I had to make.
